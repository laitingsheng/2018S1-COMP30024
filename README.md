# COMP30024AI

Project released by the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) as an assignment of subject [COMP30024 Artificial Intelligence](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp30024/print) during 2018 Semester 1 (February - June). Implemented by Mini Deep Q Learning with Temporal Difference using [Keras](https://keras.io/) with multiple keras.Dense layers for easy conversion (since machine learning frameworks such as [Keras](https://keras.io/)/[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)/[Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) won't be available for submission).

Note:
* DQNNaturePaper.pdf downloaded from from [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning/)
* TDLeaf.pdf downloaded from [Cornell University Library](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9901001.pdf) for reference to implement TDLeaf(Î»).
