COMP30024 AI Project plan

We have many ways to communicate with each other, basically via WeChat (since we
are good friends)
The overall implementation workload is undetermined since it should work as a
individual program so the code should be cohesive and coherent, but we will
implement our idea together

Remaining Deadlines before this deadline
Both:
COMP30027 Machine Learning Project 2 Stage 1 on 9 May (we are a group as well)
COMP30023 Computer Systems (Project 2 not release yet)
Tinson:
COMP90045 Programming Language Implementation on 8 May (Stage 3a submission)
Mofan:
SWEN30006 Software Modelling & Design on 29 April (Project 2)
